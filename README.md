## Overview

LeetScribe helps competitive programmers and interview candidates better understand and document their coding solutions. When you solve a LeetCode problem, LeetScribe can instantly add comprehensive comments explaining:

- **Algorithm approach** - Step-by-step breakdown of your solution
- **Time complexity** - Big O analysis with reasoning
- **Space complexity** - Memory usage analysis with reasoning
- **Inline comments** - Key steps explained throughout the code

Perfect for reviewing your submissions later or sharing well-documented solutions with others.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Analysis** - Supports multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Groq, etc.)
- **Seamless Integration** - Clean button added to LeetCode's interface
- **Smart Annotation** - Only annotates correct solutions; flags incorrect ones
- **Dark/Light Mode** - Matches your system preferences
- **Real-time Processing** - Instant analysis and code replacement
- **Secure Storage** - API credentials stored in Chrome's sync storage
- **SPA Compatible** - Works with LeetCode's single-page app navigation
